# Building an R Package

The purpose of this assessment is for you to combine your skills of creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package with releasing that package on GitHub. In this assessment you'll be taking the R files from Week 2's assessment about documentation and putting that file in an R package.

[man/](https://github.com/EnriquePH/FARS/tree/master/man) with directory
corresponding documentation files?
* Does this package contain a 
[vignette](https://github.com/EnriquePH/FARS/blob/master/vignettes/fars.Rmd) 
which provides a meaningful description of the package and how it should be 
used?
